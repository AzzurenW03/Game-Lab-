//Task 6: Update the Game class (Part II)
//Add cases for the commands "use" and "open" to your switch statement. Both will be similar to
//the "take" command you should already have. Once you have the Item, either from the current
//room or the player's inventory, call the appropriate method: use() or open().
//Play your game and make sure you can open the safe and retrieve the diamond.
